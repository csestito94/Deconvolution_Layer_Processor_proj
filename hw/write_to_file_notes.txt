---------- Write to file notes -----------

Please adapt these lines to write results stored within the DDR to a text file:

1) set logfile [open "[your_MATLAB_directory]\\results.txt" "w"]
-- the results.txt file is open in write mode within the MATLAB folder
Directory format:
- Windows: [your_MATLAB_directory]\\...
- Linux : [your_MATLAB_directory]\...

2) puts $logfile [mrd BA N]
-- the DDR is read from the Base Address (BA) and N 32-bit words are written to the results.txt file.
According to such experiment, you should set BA = 0x01400000 and N = 2278

3) close $logfile
-- the text file is closed.
